### Code Analysis and Improvement Suggestions

1. **Syntax Error in `evaluate_cost` Function**:
    - **Issue**: There's a missing parenthesis `)` on the line calculating `tempcost`.
    - **Improvement**: Correct the syntax by adding the missing parenthesis.
    ```python
    tempcost += (y_[i] - ((params[0] * x_[i,0]) + params[1])) ** 2
    ```

2. **Vectorization**:
    - **Issue**: The cost and gradient computations are performed using Python loops.
    - **Improvement**: Use NumPy's vectorized operations for better performance and readability. This can reduce complexity and improve speed for larger datasets.
    ```python
    def evaluate_cost(x_, y_, params):
        predictions = x_ @ params  # Dot product for predictions
        errors = y_ - predictions
        return np.mean(errors ** 2)

    def evaluate_gradient(x_, y_, params):
        predictions = x_ @ params
        errors = y_ - predictions
        gradient = -2/len(y_) * (x_.T @ errors)  # Vectorized gradient calculation
        return gradient
    ```

3. **Function Naming**:
    - **Issue**: The function name `udpate_params` contains a typo.
    - **Improvement**: Rename the function to `update_params` for correctness.

4. **Constants and Hardcoded Values**:
    - **Issue**: The constant values for both cost averaging and the initial parameters are hardcoded, which may lead to difficulties if further adjustments are needed.
    - **Improvement**: Define these constants at the top of the file to enhance clarity and ease of updates.
    ```python
    COST_AVERAGE_DIVISOR = 10000  # Define clear constant
    ```

5. **Parameter Handling**:
    - **Issue**: The optimizer parameters are stored in a dictionary, which affects readability and makes accessing them a bit cumbersome.
    - **Improvement**: Consider using a class to encapsulate the optimizer logic and parameters, enhancing organization and maintainability.

6. **Error Handling**:
    - **Issue**: The current error handling is broad and is likely to catch all exceptions, which obscures the underlying issue.
    - **Improvement**: Use specific exception handling to make debugging easier. For instance, handle file reading errors and ensure that exceptions provide more informative messages.

7. **Logging Instead of Print**:
    - **Issue**: The use of print statements for tracking iteration progress and errors may clutter the output.
    - **Improvement**: Use Python’s `logging` module for more flexible logging and easier toggling between levels of verbosity.
    ```python
    import logging

    logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)
    # Replace print with logging
    logging.info('data loaded. x:{} y:{}'.format(x_.shape, y_.shape))
    ```

8. **Docstrings and Comments**:
    - **Issue**: While comments are present, they could be more systematically applied, especially with function-level docstrings.
    - **Improvement**: Add docstrings for each function detailing parameters, return values, and purpose. This enhances self-descriptiveness and understandability.
    ```python
    def evaluate_cost(x_, y_, params):
        """
        Calculate the cost (mean squared error) for the given parameters.

        Parameters:
        x_ (np.ndarray): Input features.
        y_ (np.ndarray): Target values.
        params (np.ndarray): Model parameters.

        Returns:
        float: Computed cost.
        """
    ```

9. **Parameter Validation**:
    - **Issue**: There’s no validation of input parameters before calculations.
    - **Improvement**: Before calculations, you can include basic validation checks to ensure parameters and data are of the expected types and shape.

10. **Performance Metrics Tracking**:
    - **Issue**: While the cost is being printed during training, tracking other metrics indicating performance, such as gradient norm, could provide more insight.
    - **Improvement**: Add performance indicators where necessary, especially if adaptations are made to the gradient descent logic.

11. **Separation of Concerns**:
    - **Issue**: The code intermingles data loading, model training, and printed outputs.
    - **Improvement**: Consider separating the data loading, model training, and result reporting into different functions or classes to clarify the workflow.

### Summary of Changes
- Fix syntax errors and function typos.
- Utilize NumPy's capabilities to vectorize calculations.
- Define constants clearly at the top of the script.
- Adopt a class to encapsulate optimizer parameters.
- Improve error handling for clarity and debugging.
